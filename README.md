# Learning Data Structure and Algorithms

Nothing too fancy. In fact it's just an excuse to learn **Rust** and **Nim**.
Also, I never was formally educated on these topics, even if I have used many data structure and algorithm or even made some.
So I will tackle, this + learning Rust and Nim at the same time.
